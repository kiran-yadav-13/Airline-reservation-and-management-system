**Udaan - Airline Reservation and Management system **is  my *first year  academic group-project*
 `Language used` - java

In this 'Airline Reservation System Project' we have two user- **1)Customer 2)The Administrator**. 
**In Customer Window**
Customer is able to login , check his/her all BookingDetails,PaymentDetails,CancellationDetails,All Flights ,able to register his/her query and can also see the answer of the queries and notifications"
**In the administrative part**
Anyone from admin department login and can change all the Flight information, can see all custromer ,all customer payments,cancellation, booking and query and can answer these queries as well and can also add the notification have to show on this window.

**Although this project is already exsisted but we try to implement some of these unique fewatures in it : **

**1)** We have separated the customer UI and the management UI so that any random user cannot modify the flight details or any other details.

**2)**  We have added the page for asking query and another page in the Management Department to answer all the Queries.

**3)** Feature of adding notifications shown on the user/customer window.

**4)** Sending Confirmation mail after booking.

**5)** We have represented the flight seats in the form of a button so that user can select the desired seat. If the seat is already booked it turns red and we have to choose another seat.

**Refer the Screnshots folder for the screenshots of the project**
